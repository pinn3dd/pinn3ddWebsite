    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I play video games.
      And I come to realize that winners don't look for status.
      They look for improvement.

    <p>Just like jks. He got better by wanting to be better than his friends or people around him.
      And when he realized, he won IEM Katowice as a standin for FaZe clan
